- # sales_forecasting
Sales forecasting using multiple models - Seasonal Naïve, Holt-Winters, ARIMA, SARIMA and Linear Regression Model


Project Objective
Goal: The goal of this project was to apply various quantitative methods, (i.e. Times Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast the sales of the products available in the dataset.

Perform time series analysis to understand the data and trends
Use multiple forecasting models on train dataset
Finally select the best model to run the test data
Models covered in the notebook include:

Seasonal Naive Model
Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)
ARIMA Model and Seasonal ARIMA Models
Linear Regression Model
